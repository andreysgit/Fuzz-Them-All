# Fuzzer Overview

This project implements a simple, deterministic, mutation-based fuzzer written in Rust.  
The fuzzer reads an initial input seed from a `_seed_` file in the working directory, applies random mutations based on a seeded pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), and outputs the final mutated input to stdout.

## Build Instructions

`This project requires Rust`

This binary was built on macOS (Apple Silicon)

To build the fuzzer for your own machine architecture:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable will be located at:

```
./target/release/fuzzer
```

## Usage

Before running the fuzzer, make sure you are in the folder where `_seed_` is located.
    
To run the fuzzer:

```bash
./fuzzer/target/release/fuzzer <prng_seed> <num_of_iterations> > output.txt
```

- `prng_seed`: A 32-bit unsigned integer to seed the PRNG.
- `num_of_iterations`: Number of mutation iterations to perform.

Example:

```bash
./fuzzer 1337 9001 > fuzzed_input.txt
```

The output should be redirected into a file for testing against the challenge program.

## Input Generation Strategy

- Start with a fixed seed file (`_seed_`), which is not modified.
- For each iteration:
  - Each byte in the input has a 13% chance to be replaced with a randomly generated byte (0â€“255).
- Every 500 iterations, 10 random bytes are appended to the current input.
- After all iterations, the mutated input is written directly to stdout.

This mutation process is deterministic for the same combination of:
- the initial seed file,
- `prng_seed`, and
- `num_of_iterations`.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following crate:

- [`rand`](https://crates.io/crates/rand) (version 0.8): Used for deterministic pseudorandom number generation (`StdRng`).
